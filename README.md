# ADLTS
The Automated Drone Laser Tracking System (ADLTS) will be a fully automated system that integrates different technologies, hardware, and firmware in order to detect and track a threat in motion. We have decided to use a flying drone as the threat, which our system will target and aim a laser at as a countermeasure. While there are many different methods of detection, our system will be using a camera and computer vision algorithm in order to detect, track, and predict the movement of the threat. Using these coordinates and vector data, our 2-degrees of freedom turret motor system will smoothly guide our laser onto the target droneâ€™s sensor.

A Unity Simulation for the Automated Drone Laser Tracking System (ADLTS). The simulation is to run experiments for my senior design project. I want this part to advance in parallel with the rest of the project since COVID-19 won't allow my team to meet any time soon.
